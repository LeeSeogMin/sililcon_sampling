# Contributing to Silicon Sampling Research

## Overview

This repository contains experimental code and results for validating LLM-based Silicon Sampling methodology with Korean social survey data (KGSS 2023).

## Repository Purpose

This is a **research reproducibility repository** designed for:
- Academic transparency and verification
- Method replication by other researchers
- Educational purposes for studying LLM-based survey simulation

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find any issues with:
- Code execution or dependencies
- Data inconsistencies
- Documentation errors
- Reproducibility problems

Please open an issue with:
1. Clear description of the problem
2. Steps to reproduce
3. Expected vs actual behavior
4. System information (OS, Python version, package versions)

### Suggesting Improvements

We welcome suggestions for:
- Code optimization
- Additional analysis methods
- Documentation improvements
- Extended experimental designs

### Research Extensions

If you'd like to extend this research:
1. **Korean LLM Validation**: Test with Korean-native LLMs (HyperCLOVA X, Exaone, SKT GPT, KoGPT)
2. **Additional Variables**: Expand beyond the 7 KGSS variables studied
3. **Demographic Refinement**: Test different persona stratification strategies
4. **Prompt Engineering**: Optimize prompts for better response accuracy
5. **Temporal Analysis**: Validate across multiple KGSS years

### Code Contributions

For code contributions:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-analysis`)
3. Follow existing code style:
   - Korean comments in code
   - English variable names
   - Docstrings for all functions
   - Type hints where applicable
4. Test your changes
5. Submit a pull request with clear description

### Academic Citations

If you use this code or methodology in your research:
1. Cite the original paper (see README.md)
2. Reference this repository
3. Note any modifications you made
4. Share your results if possible

## Research Ethics

When extending this work:
- ✅ Use for academic research and education
- ✅ Clearly mark synthetic vs real data
- ✅ Acknowledge limitations of LLM-based methods
- ❌ Do not use for actual policy decision-making without real survey validation
- ❌ Do not claim LLM results as representative of real populations
